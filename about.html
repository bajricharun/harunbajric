          <p class="size-large">
            Hi, I’m Harun. A young and skilled backend developer with 2 years of
            working experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also say I'm a designer (not a decent one) and project
            manager. During my 2 years of experience I mostly worked on projects
            where main ideas of projects were pitched and developed by none
            other than me. It was both fun and challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person learns something new every day, and each day with those new
            things in our heads our work gets better and better, that's why I
            don't like bragging about the things I've done. I'd like to say that
            I'm ready and willing to learn new technologies, new languages and
            new skills that are required to get the job done.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my day to day life I try to think of as many as new projects as I
            can, that's why I'm 24/7 near my laptop, waiting for an idea to
            spring out and to start developing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            My positive energy always brings me into having conversations with
            open-minded individuals which always ends up with new ideas and new
            prespectives on the world, that's why I like teamwork and
            collaborative work, two heads are smarter than one! I currently work
            with one team on few projects which are managed by me.
          </p>
